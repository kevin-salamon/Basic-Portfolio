    <p>Hello there, and welcome to my portfolio - a collection of my
    ongoing web-development projects and musings. I'm a former politics
    junkie and grad, turned pool boy, turned law office grunt, before
    finally discovering a passion for coding and development. It's my
    hope that I can turn this passion into a lifestyle, and a fulfilling
    career path. Please feel free to peruse my collection of projects
    and posts and see for yourself what I'm doing, will do,
    and have done. And again, welcome.</p>
